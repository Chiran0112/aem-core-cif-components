Lightweight GraphQL based server-side components for CIF
===

I propose a lightweight approach to developing server-side components for CIF which render
GraphQL data to leverage features of HTL, Sling components and GraphQL to ensure flexibility,
extensibility and rapid development.      

### Principles for component development

- HTL friendly, HTL features and expression language used extensively
- commerce data model defined by GraphQL query
- GraphQL query located in content tree
- GraphQL results exposed to HTL as Record
- minimal Java code for common usage
